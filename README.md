# Minecraft-Shenanigans
**Iusewallhacks here, this is where i occasionally post cool stuff. The illager army is sorta a made up thing, i occasionally run them in my single player word aganist golems to see who would come out victorious**
Notes:
- Most of these comamnds will require you to have operator status in that server to execute.
- Most of these items will require a command block, so if you see a (CB) in the file name, it requries a command block to spawn and if not, then command blocks aren't required.

_heres what you can expect to find:_
- books of mass destruction
- prefilled chests or shulkers with varying items (from tnt, sharpness 255 swords, etc. You will see the contents of them listed on each.)
- modified spawn eggs that spawn overpowered mobs
- "new bosses" (what i mean by this is "really difficult to kill" type of bosses)
- combination of existing mobs into a new enemy/ally
- modified weapons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of these mobs are in an "army" of sorts, so below are all of them listed together
_Illager's Revolutionary Army_
- The Progressor (He was kicked out because of some shenanigans, and so he on his villain arc.)
- General (ARMY ARMY ARMY)
- Captain (this guy thinks he's a cool guy. he isn't.)
- Calvary (he has a horse so he's fast, but not that greatly armored.... he has a sword though.)
- Infantry (these shits are think they are THEM, but really they're only effective in swarms.)
- Rifleman (the most useless shits, their arrows are useless aganist literally anything but villagers. I advise you to put these people as the damage sponge because they are WEAK)
