# Minecraft-Shenanigans
Notes:
- Most of these comamnds will require you to have operator status in that server to execute.
- Most of these items will require a command block, so if you see a (CB) in the file name, it requries a command block to spawn and if not, then command blocks aren't required.

**Iusewallhacks here, this is where i occasionally post cool stuff.**

_heres what you can expect to find:_
- books of mass destruction
- prefilled chests or shulkers with varying items (from tnt, sharpness 255 swords, etc. You will see the contents of them listed on each.)
- modified spawn eggs that spawn overpowered mobs
- "new bosses" (what i mean by this is "really difficult to kill" type of bosses)
- combination of existing mobs into a new enemy/ally
- modified weapons
